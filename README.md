# Smart-Clothing
A mobile application for iOS using Swift and xCode. With the use of NFC read/write, RFID chips are referenced to a Firebase Realtime Database to create a user's e-wardrobe. From there, an algorithm is used to recommend articles of clothing that match well with the piece that the user has selected.
